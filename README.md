The House Pricing Detection project focuses on analyzing housing sales data from King County, USA, aiming to predict house prices through machine learning. The dataset encompasses various features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, floors, waterfront view, condition, and grade. Initial steps involved data preprocessing, including handling missing values and dropping irrelevant columns. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand feature distributions, outliers, and correlations. Subsequently, linear regression models were developed and evaluated, with Ridge regression employed to mitigate overfitting. A pipeline was constructed to streamline preprocessing and modeling processes. Cross-validation techniques were utilized to assess model performance, while polynomial transformation enhanced model complexity to capture nonlinear relationships. Ultimately, the project seeks to offer insights into housing pricing dynamics and provide robust predictive models for house prices.
